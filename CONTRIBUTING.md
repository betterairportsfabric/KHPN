# Contributing

Contributing rules can be found in our discord server, and you will need to get there because we organize who does what there.
So this will explain what each branch does : 
- master is the global release, it is always stable and without bugs
- dev: dev is the current WIP version, lots of commits happens here, you should still be able to clone it into your xplane custom scenery folder and load it into xplane (with bugs)
- 3 models only: is for WIP 3d models (.blend files only)

If you're going to work on that, i insist, please join our discord
